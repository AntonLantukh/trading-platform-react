            A cryptocurrency is difficult to counterfeit because of this security feature. Many cryptocurrencies
            are decentralized systems based on blockchain technology, a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate
            network of computers. A defining feature of a cryptocurrency, and arguably its biggest allure, is its
            organic nature; it is not issued by any central authority, rendering it theoretically immune to government
            interference or manipulation.

            The first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which still remains the most popular and most
            valuable. Today, there are thousands of alternate cryptocurrencies with various functions or specifications.
            Some of these are clones of Bitcoin while others are forks, or new cryptocurrencies that split off from
            an already existing one.
